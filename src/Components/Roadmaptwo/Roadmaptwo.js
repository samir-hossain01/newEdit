                Hidden within the metadata of the un-revealed Tenacious Tacos
                NFT collection there will be 7 Golden Tacos, and the StrEATS
                Mascot 1-of-1. The 7 Golden Tacos will correlate to the 7
                different tacos we serve in our restaurant, and the holders of
                these Golden Tacos will receive monthly payments in ETH/WETH,
                loosely based around the number of sales the corresponding menu
                item has for that month. Based off of 2021???s sales, the yearly
                income for the holders of the 7 Golden Tacos will be as follows:
                ~$5000 annually for the holder of the Golden Fish Taco ~$4500
                annually for the holder of the Golden Mango Shrimp Taco ~$3000
                annually for the holder of the Golden Beef Taco ~$2500 annually
                for the holder of the Golden Buffalo Chicken Taco ~$2000
                annually for the holder of the Golden Pork Taco ~$2000 annually
                for the holder of the Golden Chicken Taco ~$1500 annually for
                the holder of the Golden Feature Taco As for the StrEATS Mascot,
                it will have a 1-of-1 trait, the illusive ???Black Card???, this
                trait entitles the holder to eat for free at all StrEATS brand
                locations, for life!
